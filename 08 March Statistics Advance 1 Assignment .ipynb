    "Q1. What is the Probability density function?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Probability Density Function (PDF) is a concept primarily used in probability theory and statistics. It describes the probability distribution of a continuous random variable. Unlike discrete random variables which take on distinct values with specific probabilities, continuous random variables can take on any value within a certain range.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PDF itself is a function that describes the relative likelihood for a continuous random variable to take on a particular value. Mathematically, it's denoted as \\( f(x) \\) where \\( x \\) is the variable, and it satisfies two conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The function \\( f(x) \\) is non-negative for all \\( x \\).\n",
    "2. The total area under the curve of \\( f(x) \\) over the entire range of possible values for \\( x \\) equals 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simpler terms, the PDF gives you the probability of a continuous random variable falling within a particular range of values. This is often represented graphically as a curve, with the area under the curve representing the probability. The higher the curve at a certain point, the more likely it is for the random variable to take on a value in that vicinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the case of a normal distribution, the PDF is a bell-shaped curve, with the peak indicating the most probable value, and the tails indicating less probable values."

    "Q2. What are the types of Probability distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of probability distributions, each with its own characteristics and applications. Some of the most common ones include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Discrete Distributions:**\n",
    "   - **Bernoulli Distribution:** Represents the probability of success or failure in a single experiment with two possible outcomes.\n",
    "   - **Binomial Distribution:** Describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.\n",
    "   - **Poisson Distribution:** Models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, given a known average rate of occurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Continuous Distributions:**\n",
    "   - **Normal Distribution:** Also known as the Gaussian distribution, it is characterized by a symmetric bell-shaped curve. Many natural phenomena follow this distribution due to the Central Limit Theorem.\n",
    "   - **Uniform Distribution:** All values within a given interval are equally likely to occur.\n",
    "   - **Exponential Distribution:** Describes the time between events in a Poisson process, such as the time between phone calls at a call center.\n",
    "   - **Gamma Distribution:** Generalizes the exponential distribution and is often used to model waiting times or lifetimes of objects.\n",
    "   - **Beta Distribution:** Often used to model random variables constrained to a finite interval, such as proportions or probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multivariate Distributions:**\n",
    "   - **Multinomial Distribution:** Generalizes the binomial distribution to more than two categories.\n",
    "   - **Multivariate Normal Distribution:** Generalizes the normal distribution to multiple dimensions, describing the joint distribution of several correlated random variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Special Distributions:**\n",
    "   - **Student's t-Distribution:** Similar to the normal distribution but with heavier tails, commonly used in hypothesis testing.\n",
    "   - **Chi-Squared Distribution:** Used in hypothesis testing and confidence interval estimation, particularly in analyzing variance.\n",
    "   - **F-Distribution:** Used in analysis of variance (ANOVA) and regression analysis."
